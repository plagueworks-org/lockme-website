            At LockMe, we are committed to protecting the privacy and security of your personal information.
            This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard the information you provide to us
            through our Android application available on Google Play.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            LockMe is designed with privacy in mind. We do not collect any personal information from you.
            The app does not require any user accounts, registration, or login. We do not collect your name,
            email address, phone number, or any other personally identifiable information. The app functions
            entirely offline and does not transmit any data to external servers.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3>Accessibility Service Usage</h3>
            <p>
                This app uses the new Accessibility Service API to lock your phone's screen without disabling
                the non-strong authentication, such as fingerprint etc... This is the sole purpose of using
                the Accessibility Service. The app doesn't collect or use any of the data generated by the service.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>
            Since LockMe does not collect any personal information, there is no user data to use, share, or
            process. The app's sole function is to provide a convenient widget that allows you to lock your
            phone screen with a single tap. All app operations are performed locally on your device.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            As we do not collect or store any personal data, there is no risk of your information being
            compromised through our app. The app requires only the minimum permissions necessary to perform
            its core function of locking your device screen. We are committed to maintaining the security
            and integrity of the app through regular updates and security patches when necessary.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            LockMe does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics tools, or advertising networks.
            The app does not contain any advertisements or in-app purchases. Your usage of the app remains
            completely private and confined to your device.
        </p>

        <h2>Permissions</h2>
        <p>
            LockMe requires the following permissions to function properly:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Accessibility Service:</strong> Used exclusively to lock your device screen while maintaining
            biometric authentication capabilities. This permission does not grant the app access to any personal
            data or screen content.
        </p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            LockMe does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. Since the app
            does not collect any personal information from any users, it is safe for use by individuals of all ages.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with
            an updated revision date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
            Your continued use of the app after any modifications to this Privacy Policy will constitute your
            acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide by the updated Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
            Since we do not collect any personal information, there is no user data to access, correct, or delete.
            You have complete control over the app through your device settings. You can uninstall the app at any
            time, which will remove all app-related data from your device.
